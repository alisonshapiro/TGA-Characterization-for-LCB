MATLAB codes accompanying the paper "Thermogravimetric analysis as a high-throughput lignocellulosic biomass characterization method"  

For woody biomass, use the 3 files labeled woody biomass. For herbaceous biomass, use the 3 files labeled herbaceous biomass.

For each type of biomass, there are 3 files: Initial Guess, Gaussian, and Model.

Start with the Initial Guess file, and adjust parameters as needed.
Copy the parameters into the appropriate Model file and run.

Note: You will need to change the file name to specify where your data can be found.
